# Some helpful notes:
# 1.  To install docker on windows and mac: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
#     To install docker on linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
#     Make sure docker-compose is also installed
# 2.  Make sure that you place your code only in the src directory
# 3.  Do not try and modify/add/remove anything in the input directory in your code
# 4.  Do not change the folder name of the original dataset within the input directory.
#     We will use the standard names, so custom names will not work when we run it.
# 5.  To run your code open a command line at the root of the project template folder
#     and run "docker-compose up". You can add the "-d" flag at the end if you wish to
#     detach from the command line (this is only useful when debugging)
